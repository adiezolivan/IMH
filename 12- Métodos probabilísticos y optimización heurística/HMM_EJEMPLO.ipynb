    "### Problem Statement \n",
    "The following problem is from the Udacity course on Artificial Intelligence (Thrun and Norvig), chapter 11 (HMMs and filters). It involves a simple scenario where a person's current emotional state is determined by the weather on that particular day. The task is to find the underlying hidden sequence of states (in this case, the weather), given only a set of observations (moods) and information about state/observation changes."

    "\n",
    "[HMMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) are a class of probabilistic graphical models that can predict the sequence of states, given a sequence of observations that are dependent on those states, and when the states themselves are unobservable. HMMs have seen widespread success in a variety of applications, from Speech processing and Robotics to DNA Sequencing. An HMM operates according to a set of assumptions, which are :  \n",
    "1. ** Markov Assumption **  \n",
    "Current state is dependent on only the previous state.  \n",
    "2. ** Stationarity Assumption **  \n",
    "Transition probabilities are independent of time of transition.  \n",
    "3. ** Independence Assumption **  \n",
    "Each observation depends solely on the current underlying state (which in turn depends on the previous one), and is independent of other observations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An HMM is a **Generative model**, in that it attempts to find the probability of a set of observations being produced or *generated* by a class.  The parameters that we pass to the HMM class, defined below, are:  \n",
    "*O* = a set of observations  \n",
    "*S* = a set of states  \n",
    "*A* = transition probabilities, represented as a matrix  \n",
    "*B* = emission probabilities, represented as a matrix  \n",
    "*pi* = initial state probabilties  \n",

    "### Viterbi Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The Viterbi algorithm is a Dynamic Programming algorithm for decoding the observation sequence to uncover the most probable state sequence. Given the required parameters, it starts from the initial state and uses the transition/emission information to calculate probabilities of subsequent states. Information from the previous step is passed along to the next, similar to a belief propagation mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "We store the results of each step in a table or matrix of size $k * t$, where k is the number of possible states, and t is the length of the observation sequence. The idea here is to find the path through possible states that has the maximum probability. Since initially we do not have a transition from state to state, we multiply the initial probabilities (from pi) and $P(\\;observation\\;|\\;state\\;)$ (from emission matrix B).  \n",
    "Eg. For the first day, we have the observation as Happy, so:   \n",
    "$P(R_{1}) = P(R_{0}) * P(H|R_{1}) = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2$      \n",
    "$P(S_{1}) = P(S_{0}) * P(H|S_{1}) \\;= 0.5 * 0.9 = 0.45$    \n",
    "We log both these results in the table, since we are starting from an initial state. For the following observations, however, each state has only its maximum probability of moving to the next state logged.  \n",
